## Lost in data Translation

<h3>Industry</h3>

::: {style="text-align: center"}
> Hire as many data scientists as you can find you’ll still be lost without translators to connect analytics with real business value. [...]
> By 2025 __Chief Data Officers__ and their teams function as a __business unit with profit-and-loss responsibilities__. The unit, in partnership with business teams, is responsible for ideating new ways to use data, __developing a holistic enterprise data strategy (and embedding it as part of a business strategy)__, and incubating new sources of revenue by __monetizing data services and data sharing__.

[McKinsey and Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-analytics/our-insights/the-data-driven-enterprise-of-2025)

<h3>Academia</h3>

. . .

::: {style="text-align: center"}
> The __empirics-first approach__ is not antagonistic to theory but rather can serve as a stepping-stone to theory. The approach lends itself well to __today’s data-rich environment__, which can __reveal novel research questions__ untethered to theory. [...] we argue that [empirics first] has a natural arc that bends more easily back to __real-world implications__.
