## Lost in data Translation

<h3>Industry</h3>

::: {style="text-align: center"}
> Hire as many data scientists as you can find you’ll still be lost without translators to connect analytics with real business value. [...]
> By 2025 __Chief Data Officers__ and their teams function as a __business unit with profit-and-loss responsibilities__. The unit, in partnership with business teams, is responsible for ideating new ways to use data, __developing a holistic enterprise data strategy (and embedding it as part of a business strategy)__, and incubating new sources of revenue by __monetizing data services and data sharing__.
::: 
[McKinsey and Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-analytics/our-insights/the-data-driven-enterprise-of-2025)

. . .

<h3>Academia</h3>

. . .

::: {style="text-align: center"}
> The __empirics-first approach__ is not antagonistic to theory but rather can serve as a stepping-stone to theory. The approach lends itself well to __today’s data-rich environment__, which can __reveal novel research questions__ untethered to theory. [...] we argue that [empirics first] has a natural arc that bends more easily back to __real-world implications__.

:::

## Creating Value with Data

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="32%"}
::: {.nonincremental}
1. **Identify Opportunity**
:::

::: {.incremental}
- Theory is in short supply
- Observations do not align with theory
- Literature is equivocal
- Intuition leads to multiple plausible and conflicting outcomes
- Newly emergent data allows scantly-/un-examined relationships to be probed
- Find consequential DVs and actionable IVs
:::
:::
::: {.column width="32%"}
::: {.fragment}

2. **Explore Terrain**
:::

::: {.incremental}
- Start with open ended research question
- Scope re-definition based on empirical findings
- Risk: "scope creep"
- **Listen to the data**
- **Generate robust and meaningful findings**
:::
:::

::: {.column width="32%"}
::: {.fragment}

3. **Advance Understanding**
:::

::: {.incremental}
- Uncover empirical regularities (repeatable over circumstances)
- Concern with effect sizes
- Empirical findings can question existing theory
- Empirical findings can initiate theory development
:::
::: {.nonincremental}
::: {.fragment}
- Take the "third mission" seriously
    - managers, consumers
    - policy makers, educators
    - general public
:::
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
2. Listen to data
- Validate data
- Model free evidence
- Causality?
- Robustness to modelling approach/ methods/ samples
    - Honestly atempt to falsify!
- Breadth of investigation (industries, countries)
- Depth of investigation (moderators, mediators)
:::

## {.center}

> **If you torture the data long enough, it will confess to anything**

Ronald Coase


## Listen to the Data

::: {.footer}

:::

- Reliability and credibility of sources
- Visualization
    - Establish "face-validity" of statistical findings
    - e.g., @bermanValueDescriptiveAnalytics2022 study the adoption of retail analytics dashboards and "find an increase of 4%–10% in average weekly revenues postadoption"

::: {.fragment}
::: {style="text-align: center"}
![](Graphics/retail1.png){height="600"}
:::
:::

## Listen to the Data 

- Ensure robustness
- Consider: 
    - different moderators, mediators, confounders, models
    - different methods
    - different subsets of data

::: {.fragment}
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

e.g., Simpson's Paradox

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| echo: false
library(ggplot2)
library(modelsummary)
set.seed(42)
x <- sort(runif(150, 0, 10))
y1 <- 4 + 0.5 * x + 2*rnorm(150)
y2 <- 0.45*x + 2*rnorm(150)
df <- data.frame(x, y = c(y1[1:75],y2[41:115]), g = c(rep(' A', 75), rep(' B', 75)))
ggplot(df, aes(x=x,y=y)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = FALSE) +
    theme_minimal()
```

> **Failed robustness checks should be viewed as learning opportunities that lead to an even broader exploration that considers why a finding obtains in one context but not another**

@golderLearningDataEmpiricsFirst2022

## Listen to the Data

- Incorporate prior knowledge
    - Using (informal) expert knowledge is desireable 
    - Provide initial ideas to explore
    - Develop expectations about (causal) relationships
    - Be suspicious of contrary findings

> Traditionally theory-agnostic predictive analytics tools are likely to have larger impact and lesser bias if they are able to smartly combine theoretical insights [...] with large troves of data. 

@bradlowRoleBigData2017a

## Listen to the Data

- Explore causality
    - make use of (quasi-)experiments [@goldfarbConductingResearchMarketing2022]
        
        > Good natural experiments are studies in which there is a transparent exogenous source of variation in the explanatory variables that determine treatment assignment.

        @meyer1995natural
    - choose appropritate models [@cunningham2021causal]
    - think about good and bad controls [@cinelli2020crash]
    - explore multiple causal pathways
 
## Aside: Necessary and Sufficient Conditions

::: {.footer}

:::

**Observation: The floor is wet**

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.callout-note}
## Necessary Condition

Without such a condition the observation _cannot_ happen.

e.g., Water was "applied" to the floor.
:::
::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
- Being signed up in LPIS to get a grade
- Being at least 35 years old to become Austrian president
- For whole numbers $>2$: Being odd to be prime
:::



:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.callout-note}
## Sufficient Condition

If such a condition is met the observation happens.

e.g., It is raining right now.
:::
::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
- You arriving before me $\rightarrow$ not miss any of the lecture
- Receiving $>50\%$ of votes in a presidential election $\rightarrow$ become Austrian president 
- A number being divisible by $4$ $\rightarrow$ be even
:::

:::
::::

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}
**Can you think of counter examples for each?**

e.g., Being at least 1.5m tall is not a necessary condition to become Austrian president

**What happens if you "flip" conditions?**

e.g., Getting a grade is ... to know you are signed up in LPIS
:::
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}
**What happens if you negate conditions?**

e.g., Not being signed up on LPIS is ... to know you will not receive a grade

**Which of the examples are necessary _and_ sufficient?** 

Can you come up with more?

:::

## Think different

__Setup__

- Introduce "the crazy ones": Einstein, Dylan, MLK, Earhart...
- "See things differently", "not fond of rules", "no respect for the status quo" 

. . .

__Confrontation__

- "You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify, or vilify them"
- You should buy-in because: "the only thing you can't do is ignore them"
- "While some may see them as the crazy ones..."

. . .

__Resolution__

- "We see genius."
- "Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do."
